## Overview

This is my Neovim config. It's very minimal and fast

## Installation

This config should work on Neovim 0.7+ 

Make sure to backup your current config. Then clone this repository to ~/.config/nvim.

git clone https://github.com/duyhungdz/nvim ~/.config/nvim 

This will also install Packer automatically. Now just open Neovim and run :PackerSync

nvim +PackerSync
